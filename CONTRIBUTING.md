## How to Submit Pull Requests

We actively welcome your pull requests! Follow these steps:

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/hiremetrics.git
cd hiremetrics

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL-OWNER/hiremetrics.git
```

### 2. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
# Update your fork with the latest changes
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main

# Create a new branch for your feature
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 3. Make Your Changes

- Write clear, concise commit messages
- Follow the [coding style guidelines](#coding-style-guidelines)
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed
- Keep commits focused and atomic


### 4. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
# Push to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# Go to GitHub and create a Pull Request
```

### Pull Request Guidelines

- **Title**: Use a clear, descriptive title
- **Description**: Explain what changes you made and why
- **Link related issues**: Use keywords like "Fixes #123" or "Closes #456"
- **Screenshots**: Include screenshots for UI changes
- **Breaking changes**: Clearly mark any breaking changes
- **Keep it focused**: One feature/fix per PR when possible

---

## Coding Style Guidelines

We maintain consistent code style across the project to ensure readability and maintainability.

### Python (Backend & ETL)

We use **Black** and **isort** for automatic code formatting:

- **Black version**: `25.9.0`
- **isort version**: `6.1.0` with `--profile black`

#### Formatting Your Code

```bash
# Format backend code
black ./backend
isort --profile black --filter-files ./backend

# Format ETL code
black ./etl
isort --profile black --filter-files ./etl
```

**Best practices:**
- Follow PEP 8 (enforced by Black)
- Use type hints and docstrings
- Keep functions focused and concise
- Use meaningful names

### JavaScript/Vue (Frontend)

Use **ESLint** for code linting:

```bash
# Lint frontend code
cd frontend
npm run lint
```

**Best practices:**
- Follow **Vue 3 Composition API** with `<script setup>` syntax
- Use **ESLint** configuration provided
- Use **Tailwind CSS** utility classes
- Use **Pinia stores** for state management
- Keep components focused and reusable

---

## Running Tests

We maintain comprehensive test suites to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

### Backend Tests

Our backend tests are located in `backend/tests/` and use **pytest**.

#### Test Structure

```
backend/tests/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ conftest.py              # Pytest fixtures and configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ routers/                 # Tests for API endpoints
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_companies.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_auth.py
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test_skills.py
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/                   # Tests for utility functions
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_auth.py
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test_query_builder.py
```

#### Running Tests Locally

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run all tests
pytest -v

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/routers/test_companies.py
```

#### Writing Tests

Follow the **Arrange-Act-Assert** pattern:

```python
def test_get_top_companies_with_filters(mock_db_session):
    # Arrange: Set up test data and mocks
    mock_result = MagicMock()
    mock_result.mappings.return_value.all.return_value = [
        {"company_name": "Test Corp", "job_count": 100}
    ]
    mock_db_session.execute.return_value = mock_result
    
    # Act: Call the function being tested
    result = get_top_companies(db=mock_db_session, limit=10)
    
    # Assert: Verify the results
    assert len(result) == 1
    assert result[0]["company_name"] == "Test Corp"
```

### CI/CD Workflows

GitHub Actions workflows in `.github/workflows/` automatically run on push/PR to `main`:

1. **`backend-pytest.yml`** - Runs all backend tests with Python 3.11
2. **`code-formatting.yml`** - Checks backend/ETL code formatting with Black and isort
3. **`frontend-lint.yml`** - Runs ESLint checks on frontend code

**All tests and linting checks must pass before merging.**

## Review Process and Expectations

### Timeline

- **Initial response**: Within 2-3 business days
- **Review**: Maintainers will evaluate functionality, code quality, tests, and documentation
- **Iteration**: Address feedback as needed
- **Merge**: Once approved and all checks pass

### Review Criteria

- ‚úÖ **Code Quality** - Follows style guidelines, well-documented, clear naming
- ‚úÖ **Testing** - Includes tests for new features, existing tests pass
- ‚úÖ **Documentation** - Updated as needed (README, docstrings)
- ‚úÖ **Automated Checks** - All GitHub Actions workflows pass

### Tips for Faster Reviews

- Keep PRs small and focused
- Write clear descriptions explaining what and why
- Respond promptly to feedback
